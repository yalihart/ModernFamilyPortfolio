      <h3>ABOUT LUKE DUNPHY</h3>
      <p class="char-desc">
        Luke is a rambunctious, playful, mischievous, and immature teenage boy
        who is often doing his own thing. He is also known for being a boy with
        low intelligence, which he has supposedly inherited from
        <a href="phil.html">his father</a>, who is not very smart either.
